# About

This script was made to quickly setup and configure [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org) as I distro hop frequently and hate the default terminal look.

What this script does:
 - Installs [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org) (apt/pacman)
 - Installs [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/)
 - Adds Plugins: [zsh-autosuggestion](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
 - Makes [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org) default shell
 
Install using this
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/al-rafi304/zsh-installer/raw/main/zsh-installer.sh)"
```
